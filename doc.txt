TITLE: IN THE CLUTCHES OF BETH MIRAGE
Subtitle: The Illusion that Kills the Soul
DEDICATION
To those whom Beth Mirage took entirely.
This book is dedicated to the memory of those whose stories could not be told by themselves. To those who lost their jobs, their families, and ultimately, their hope, succumbing to the weight of a debt that was not only financial, but of the soul.
We dedicate these pages to the heroes who fell along the way and to the families who today carry the emptiness of their absence. May the sacrifice of their lives serve as the warning cry they could not give. You have not been forgotten.
Beth Mirage doesn't kill all at once. But, through this record, we will fight so that she doesn't take anyone else.
PREFACE: BETH MIRAGE'S JUDAS KISS
You know her. Maybe not by the name we gave her, but you've already smelled her perfume on your cell phone. She appears dressed in green, gold, and promises. She smiles at you on social media through the face of that influencer you trust. She shouts her name during game breaks, promising that with her, you're not just a fan—you're an "investor."
Her name is Beth Mirage.
At first, she's the perfect companion for boredom. She gives you gifts—the famous bonuses—and makes you believe that you've finally found a way to beat the system. But Beth is a cruel lover. She doesn't want your money; she wants your total devotion.
This book isn't about statistics. It's about the trail of destruction: broken marriages, careers thrown in the trash, and the transformation of human beings into "Zombies." Beth Mirage doesn't kill all at once. She consumes you slowly.
CHAPTER 1: THE FIRST KISS
She doesn't come kicking down the door. Beth Mirage is polite. Marcos, a sales manager and father of two, met her one Sunday afternoon. "I won 50 reais betting 5," he thought. It was their first kiss.
What Marcos didn't realize was that with each bet, Beth took a piece of his time. First, he stopped playing with his children to check scores. Then, dinner with his wife became a nuisance. In three months, Beth was no longer fun. She was a necessity. When he lost, she whispered: "Just one more time, and I'll give you everything back." Marcos gave up his credit card limit, his overdraft, and finally, the peace of his home.
CHAPTER 2: THE GLASS WALL (ISOLATION)
Beth Mirage is jealous. She builds a glass wall around herself. You still see people, but you don't hear them anymore. Ricardo was at his daughter's 5th birthday party, but his mind was locked in the bathroom, sweating profusely because of a game in Croatia. He didn't hear the "congratulations." He only heard his own heart beating, because he had "borrowed" the girl's school money. The addict becomes a Zombie: present in body, but with his soul trapped in a graph that goes up and down.
CHAPTER 3: THE THEFT OF THE SOUL (THE DEVIATION OF CHARACTER)
Beth removes the moral compass. Helena, a trusted accountant for 15 years, started with a "guaranteed profit." When her money ran out, she looked at the company's cash register. The first embezzlement was 500 reais. The last one accumulated 120,000. The worst moment wasn't the lawsuit, but the day she used the money for her own mother's cataract surgery. Beth convinces the victim that the only way out of the hole is to keep digging.
CHAPTER 4: PORTRAITS OF A ZOMBIE (THE EMPTY SHELL)
The Zombie doesn't sleep; he shuts down from exhaustion. Paulo, a brilliant university student, aged ten years in two. At his grandfather's wake, he felt irritated because the Wi-Fi signal was too bad to check his bets. The Zombie has a glassy gaze, selective silence, and abandons his own hygiene. Nothing brings joy anymore: not a hug, not an achievement. Beth has become the only sun in a dark solar system.
CHAPTER 5: THE HERO'S PATH (THE ESCAPE)
Escaping Beth Mirage is like tearing off your own skin. André lost his car and apartment, but decided to face his reflection in the mirror. The hero's first step is total humiliation: admitting the addiction to his family. Beth dies in the light; she feeds on the secret.
To win, the hero hands over his finances to third parties, blocks apps, and faces the "dopamine desert"—the gray days where the brain relearns to live without the game. The reward is not the money back, but the freedom to taste food and the value of a sincere hug.
